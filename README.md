# curses-screensaver
CLI based screensaver made to reduce burn-in on LCD and maybe CRT terminals. It achieves this effect by flashing bands on the screen to hopefully wipe out
burn-in given enough time. This is more of a spur-of-the-moment project and I have not tested it on any displays.

If the terminal operates over a slow serial connection, adjust the delay to a higher number.

# syntax
./curses-screensaver.py \<delay\>
